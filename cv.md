I'm a recent Makers Academy graduate with a passion for problem solving and coding. I'm looking for a role in web development with an experienced team to help me develop my skills and kickstart my career in software.

## Skills

#### Ruby

During my time at Makers, I developed multiple applications in Ruby and Rails. My most impressive acheivements were:

  - [Igniteit](https://github.com/IgniteIt/ignite_it) - a site for crowdfunding community projects, developed on Rails
  - [Gymbuddy](https://github.com/sanjsanj/gymbuddy) - a site to find people who go to your gym to be your buddy, also developed using rails
  - [A sinatra app?]

The applications above include javascript on the front end, however I have also developed some applications solely in JS. I used node to run the backend in these applications:
